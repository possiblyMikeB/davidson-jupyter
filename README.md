# Davidson Juypter Runtime
This is a collection of packages, modules, and depencencies which provide a baseline Jupyter runtime environment used by JupyterHub services at Davidson College.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/possiblyMikeB/davidson-jupyter.git
$ cd davidson-jupyter
$ pip install -U pip && pip install --no-cache-dir .
```
